The definition of an event horizon is a boundary in spacetime beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer.<br/><br/>

Now since events inside this boundary cannot affect anything outside, it should be intuitive that anything that enters this boundary cannot go back out. That's exactly what a black hole is.<br/><br/>

To understand why this happens, take a look at the diagram on the right. The curve is<br/>caused by the mass of the black hole at the bottom, and the slope of the curve<br/>represents the gravitational strength. The force required to escape the gravitational<br/>pull of a black hole is given from this formula:

This is the formula for escape velocity.<br/>
G is the gravitational constant.<br/>
M is the mass of the body.<br/>
r is the distance from the body.<br/><br/>

In the diagram, objects <span style="color: green">green</span>, <span style="color: blue">blue</span>, <span style="color: orange">orange</span>, <span style="color: red">red</span> are at varying distances from the<br/>black hole, and the arrows represent their escape velocity. The closer the object, the <br/>higher the escape velocity (r is smaller, v<sub>e</sub> is bigger).<br/><br/>

The <span style="color: green">green</span> and <span style="color: blue">blue</span> objects can still escape, since they are outside the event horizon. The <span style="color: red">red</span> is inside the event horizon, and has an escape velocity higher than that of the speed of light, and cannot escape.<br/>

The <span style="color: orange">orange</span> object is at the event horizon, and this means its escape velocity equals the speed of light. This distance from the black hole has a special name: the Schwarzchild radius. Any given mass has a Schwarzschild radius, and if it was compressed inside that radius, it would become a black hole.
